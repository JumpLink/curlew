// its client goes away, and DROPS a tool that declares itself mutating.
//
// Launched via `gjsify run` (the production entry): it resolves every dependency's native
// prebuild paths on its own and keeps stdout uncontaminated (its banner goes to stderr), so we
// spawn it with a CLEAN env — no manual LD_LIBRARY_PATH / GI_TYPELIB_PATH. A green run proves
// no launcher wrapper is needed.
//
// Prerequisite: `gjsify install` + `gjsify workspace postbote-cli build`, and gjs on PATH.
// Run with: `node app/tests/integration/mcp-gjs-smoke.mjs`.

// `registerTool` would serve exactly the same catalogue and section 1 would still pass. It
// cannot distinguish a working gate from no gate at all.

// tools that must be dropped, through the same `server.registerTool` the real tools use, after
// the gate has wrapped it.
//
// TWO runs, and the second is the point. "Canary absent" alone is worthless evidence: it is
// equally consistent with the gate dropping it and with the canary never being registered. The
// run with writes ALLOWED must show the canary present, which is what proves the first run's
// absence was the gate acting rather than nothing happening.
