/**
 * Real network, no account: open a WhatsApp socket through `@curlew/whatsapp`'s own client
 * construction (Baileys + the gjsify WebSocket shim + curlew's silent logger) for a fresh,
 * unlinked device, and wait for the first QR code. Proves the WebSocket, the noise handshake,
 * protobuf, libsignal's key generation and the WASM bridge work on GJS — the whole stack a real
 * link stands on — without a phone. The QR code is never printed; nothing is linked.
 *
 * The device keys go to curlew's own session storage in a temporary directory, which checks
 * the auth state's first write (creds as TEXT, file 0600) on the way, and is deleted after.
 *
 * Not part of CI (it needs the network). Run: `gjsify workspace curlew-cli test:whatsapp-network`
