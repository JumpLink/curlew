/**
 * Tools that MUST NOT be served — the read-only gate's discriminator.
 *
 * The gate is the one safety-critical piece of this server, and until this file existed nothing
 * could tell a working gate from an absent one. Every real tool declares `readOnlyHint: true`, so
 * a gate that had silently stopped wrapping `registerTool` — an SDK rename, a registration path
 * that bypasses the wrapper, a bundler transform — would serve the exact same catalogue and
 * every assertion in the suite would stay green. That is a guard whose failure is invisible,
 * which is the same as no guard.
 *
 * The gate is `@gjsify/mcp`'s since 0.54.0 (it was this repo's, in `runtime.ts`, until then).
 * That raises the bar rather than lowering it: these canaries now have to catch a gate that
 * drifts UPSTREAM, which is why they stay.
 *
 * So this registers tools that must be dropped. Absent from `tools/list` = the gate closed.
 * Present = the gate is open and everything else the suite claims about read-only-ness is
 * worthless. Why there are two of them, and why the second is the one that matters, is on
 * `GATE_CANARY_TOOLS` below.
 *
 * Off unless `POSTBOTE_MCP_GATE_CANARY=1`, so it costs the shipped server nothing, and the
 * handlers are inert in any case: they perform no write, they only report having been
 * reachable. Enabling them can therefore never grant a capability — the worst case is two
 * tools that return an error string.

/**
 * TWO canaries, because one does not cover the failure that actually happens.
 *
 * Measured, not reasoned: with only the `readOnlyHint: false` canary in place, the gate was
 * rewritten to the fail-open spelling its own comment warns about —
 * `readOnlyHint === false ? undefined : register` — and the entire integration suite stayed
 * GREEN. Both spellings drop a tool that declares itself mutating, so that canary cannot tell
 * them apart. The difference between them is the UNANNOTATED tool: the correct gate drops it,
 * the fail-open one serves it. That is also the realistic defect, since an unannotated tool is
 * what a forgetful author produces, whereas nobody writes `readOnlyHint: false` by accident.
 *
 * So the second canary carries no `annotations` key at all, and it is the one with teeth.
