 * Where the catalogues are and which one this run speaks.

 * The split is deliberate: `@curlew/protocol`'s `i18n.ts` owns the gettext RUNTIME and imports
 * nothing, because every package may reach for it and none of them may touch a filesystem. This
 * module is the host half — it finds the `.mo`, reads the bytes, and hands them over.
 *
 * Call {@link initI18n} once, before the first translatable string is produced: a message already
 * formatted keeps the language it was built in. That is why it is the first statement of
 * `src/index.ts`, ahead of yargs — every `describe` string is evaluated while the parser is built.
