/**
 * The backend ports: `MessageBackend` (network-neutral) and `MailBackend` (the mailbox driver).
 *
 * Every backend implements `MessageBackend` — a manifest plus its accounts — and is loaded
 * through the app's registry. HOW its messages are synced is a driver on top, picked by `kind`:
 * `mailbox` (folders, UIDs, UIDVALIDITY — IMAP-shaped, and the reason it is not forced into a
 * chat shape) and `chat` (dialogs with a per-chat monotonic message sequence, for server-archive
 * chat networks: Telegram, Matrix, XMPP with MAM) and `delivery` (events pushed once by a
 * network with no server archive: WhatsApp, later Signal).
 *
 * The `MailBackend` interface is the load-bearing seam of the project. `@postbote/store` drives the sync
 * engine THROUGH it and never imports `@postbote/imap`, which is the only reason the most
 * intricate code here — incremental sync, UIDVALIDITY handling, expunge detection — can be
 * unit-tested on Node against a fake backend and an in-memory database, with no server, no
 * network and no GOA session.
 *
 * If you find yourself wanting to import `imap` from `store`, add a method here instead.
