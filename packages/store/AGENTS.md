# AGENTS.md — @curlew/store

Local state: XDG paths, attachment writing, the SQLite full-text index and the sync engine.
The repo-wide rules are in [../../AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md); this file is the store-specific
layer and wins where they differ.

## The one rule that shapes this package

**`store` must never import a backend** (`imap`, `telegram`, `whatsapp`). The sync engines are driven
through the `MailBackend`, `ChatBackend` and `DeliveryBackend` ports
declared in `@curlew/protocol` and injected by `app`. That keeps this package free of `gi://`
even transitively, which is the only reason `sync.ts` — the most intricate code in the project —
can be unit-tested on Node against a fake backend and `:memory:`. If you want to reach into
`imap` from here, add a method to the port instead.

`node:*` is fine. `gi://` is not, at any depth.

## SQLite here is libgda, not sqlite3

gjsify's `node:sqlite` is a **libgda 6.0 wrapper**. The API is `DatabaseSync`, so it looks like
Node's, but six behaviours leak through and every one of them will bite you.

| # | Behaviour | What it forces |
|---|---|---|
| a | `all()` / `get()` used to **swallow exceptions** and return `[]`, so a broken query answered EMPTY — indistinguishable from "nothing matched", and a broken index looked like an empty mailbox. Fixed in gjsify#1838: a failure reaches the caller | Still build FTS `MATCH` with `toFts5Match()` and never from raw input — a malformed `MATCH` is a syntax error, and now it is a *thrown* one, which turns a search into a failed command instead of no results. `probeFts5()` still runs at open time: it is what says a missing FTS5 module is a broken build rather than an index with nothing in it. |
| b | `exec()` splits multi-statement strings itself and does not understand `BEGIN … END` | **No triggers.** A trigger body would be cut into broken fragments. One statement per array entry in `schema.ts`, and no SQL comments inside those strings — the splitter is not a SQL parser. |
| c | Parameters are **interpolated as escaped SQL literals**, not bound | Positional `?` only. The named path substitutes `:name` across the whole statement without excluding string literals. Do not store BLOBs. |
| d | An FTS `SELECT` parses as `UNKNOWN`, so the wrapper tries `execute_non_select`, throws, and retries as a select | **Every FTS query runs twice.** Keep them narrow — `rowid` + `rank`, with a `LIMIT` — and hydrate the rows in a second, ordinary `SELECT`. |
| e | libgda cached every executed statement per connection, and each held a GWeakRef on the SQLite provider, which the whole PROCESS shares (GLib caps it at 65 535). A `run()` cost ~4 (it also selected `changes()` and `last_insert_rowid()`), so after ~16 000 of them in one process every SELECT returned `[]` on any connection, a fresh one included. Fixed in gjsify#1838: every execution releases its state | **Keep the batched writes anyway — for speed, not survival.** `insertMany` (multi-row, 120 bound values a statement) and set-based `uid IN (…)` chunks stay because re-parsing one wide statement costs less than parsing many narrow ones, not because a one-row `run()` would break the index. `db.test.ts` pins reads after 20 000 writes; the 6 000-message resync in `sync.test.ts` pins the batch shapes. |
| f | A declared `INTEGER` column is read **exactly**: a value above 2^31-1 (a millisecond timestamp) comes back as a Number like any other, and only a value past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` throws (`ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE`), which is what node:sqlite does. Fixed in gjsify#1841 | Nothing to work around — `seqColumn()` is now only an alias. Never alias an expression back over a column you also `ORDER BY` unqualified: the alias wins, and a text expression sorts as text. |

Two more, smaller:

- **The database filename must end in `.db`.** libgda appends the suffix itself, so
  `index.sqlite` lands on disk as `index.sqlite.db`. `indexDbPath()` enforces it; `openIndexDb()`
  checks again.
- **`remove_diacritics 2` folds diacritics, not `ß`.** `Grüße` indexes as `gruße`, so `grusse`
  finds nothing. Pinned by a test so it is not mistaken for a bug.

Because of (b) the FTS table is maintained by application code, in the same transaction as the
`messages` write. That is better than a trigger anyway: an `AFTER UPDATE` trigger would fire on
every `\Seen` change and rewrite the whole FTS row, body included.

## Conversations are derived

`conversations`, `conversation_messages`, `participants` and their link tables are rewritten
from `messages` by `rebuildConversations` after every sync, in one transaction. Threading
is a union over the whole mailbox and a message's class depends on its thread (did the user
reply?), so a full rebuild is the simple correct form; ids are hashes of stable inputs, so they
survive it. Per-sender overrides are NOT stored here — they come from the config and apply at
read time, and `peopleOnlyClause` (SQL) must keep agreeing with `conversationVerdict` (JS);
a test pins both directions.

## Chats are written once, and linked on every rebuild

`syncChats` (the `chat` driver's engine) writes chat messages into `conversation_messages`
directly, incrementally, with a per-chat cursor in `chat_cursors`. They are NOT rewritten by the
rebuild: a chat history is far larger than a mailbox's thread set and rewriting it every sync
would spend the execution budget of (e) for nothing. What the rebuild does redo, set-based in a
handful of statements, is the link into the participant directory (`chat_peer_links`, sender
ids, memberships, `known-contact`), because the address book can change without a new message.
A conversation is a chat because it has a cursor row — never because of its backend's name.

Deletions: an incremental chat run only walks forward and cannot see a deleted message. A full
scan re-takes each chat's newest window and removes the stored messages inside the range the
window covers (`deletedBy`) plus every chat gone from the list — the chat counterpart of the
expunge pass, and the only one. Do not narrow it.

A network that reports deletions and edits IN its history (XMPP retractions and corrections,
Matrix redactions and `m.replace`) hands them over on the page: `ChatHistoryPage.retracted`
removes stored messages on every run, not only a full scan, and `ChatHistoryPage.edits` rewrites
a stored body — after the inserts, so both also land on messages of the same batch. An edit that
names its sender (`ChatEdit.senderRemoteId`, Matrix) only lands on a message by that sender.

Chat bodies live on their `conversation_messages` row (`body`); mail bodies stay once in the
FTS table.

## Delivered chats are the only copy

`receiveDeliveries` (the `delivery` driver's engine, `delivery-sync.ts`) writes the same chat
tables as `syncChats` — `conversation_messages`, `chat_peers`, `chat_members`, a `chat_cursors`
row per chat — so every read path, the rebuild and the participant link treat a delivered chat
like an archived one. The difference is where the truth is: a delivery-only network (WhatsApp)
forgets a message once this device acknowledged it, so these rows are `state`. Consequences:

- Each batch is written in ONE transaction before the next is asked for; a failed write stops
  the account instead of receiving more into nothing.
- Edits, deletions, "clear chat", read state arrive as events and are applied in the batch —
  there is no full scan to fall back on. A message re-delivered replaces its row.
- A `chat-merged` event (one chat the network addressed two ways, e.g. a WhatsApp person by phone
  number, then by LID) splits its batch: rows before it are written, the chat's rows are re-keyed
  into the target in multi-row statements, then the rest — all in the batch's one transaction.
- Asking the session for the next batch IS the acknowledgement that the previous one is
  committed; a session with a write-ahead journal drops it then. Never call `nextBatch()` after
  a failed write.
- The rebuild must keep leaving chat rows alone (it deletes only `backend = 'mail'` rows). A
  schema change that rewrites `conversation_messages` wholesale would destroy them.
- Budget: a batch costs a fixed handful of statements plus its multi-row inserts (22 columns →
  5 rows a statement). Edits of already-stored messages are the one per-item statement.

## Where data lives — the actual privacy guarantee

Nothing is ever written inside the repository. The index holds mail headers **and plain-text
bodies**, and this repo is public, so a stray index file would be a permanent leak.

- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/curlew/index.db`, mode `0600`, re-applied on every open.
- Attachments to `$XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/curlew/attachments`, dir mode `0700`.
- Backend secrets (chat sessions) in `SecretStore` files under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/curlew/secrets/`,
  0600 in 0700, TEXT only (bytes as base64 — BLOBs do not survive (c)), writes batched.
- Overridable only through `CURLEW_DATA_DIR` / `CURLEW_DB_PATH` / `CURLEW_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` /
  `CURLEW_SECRETS_DIR`.

`.gitignore` is the second line of defence. Not writing there is the first, and it lives in
`paths.ts` — whose tests take the environment as a parameter precisely so this is checkable.

**Only `curlew sync` and `curlew daemon` write to the index.** A search never does. One
mental model, and no surprise disk growth from a read. The daemon (ADR 0002) reaches the same
`receiveDeliveries` in `follow` mode, and the **receive lease** (`receive-lease.ts`, one row per
backend+account) is what keeps the two off the same account: BOTH modes take it inside
`receiveAccount` — the one place that connects — refresh it while receiving and drop it at the
end. The row carries the holder, when it was last heard from, and when it **expires**: the expiry
is the HOLDER's own (heartbeat + 3 × its refresh interval), so a taker judges a lease by one
comparison and cannot shorten somebody else's. A `sync` that finds a live one stands down and
reports the holder; a daemon waits and takes it when it is free; an expired one is a crashed
holder. Nothing else may connect a delivery account around the lease.

## Attachment writing

`safeFileName()` (in `protocol`) has already reduced a hostile MIME name to one path segment.
`download.ts` is defence in depth on top: join, resolve, and verify the result is still inside
the target directory. Never overwrite — an existing name gains ` (2)`. Write to `.part` and
rename only on success, so a failed transfer leaves NO file; a half-written PDF that opens and
shows the first three pages is worse than none.
