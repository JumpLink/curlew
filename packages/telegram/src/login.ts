/**
 * `postbote accounts add telegram` — the interactive login, as a function the CLI calls with its
 * terminal prompts.
 *
 * The session is created under a temporary name and moved to `<account id>.db` only once the
 * login succeeded, so a cancelled or failed login never leaves a half-authorized session that
 * `sync` would then try to use. Logging in to an account that already has a session replaces it.
 *
 * The api_id/api_hash come from the environment or are asked for first, and are stored in the
 * session file — never in the config. A login that is killed outright leaves its pending file;
 * the next `accounts add` or account listing sweeps it once it is stale.
 *
 * Nothing secret is returned or printed: not the phone number, not the code, not the password,
 * not the api_hash, not the session. The result is the account id and the public identity (`@username` or name).
