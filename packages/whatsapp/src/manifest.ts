    summary:
      "postbote connects to WhatsApp as a linked device through Baileys, an UNOFFICIAL reimplementation of the WhatsApp Web protocol. It is not an official WhatsApp client, and using it violates WhatsApp's Terms of Service: WhatsApp can ban the account — your phone number — temporarily or for good, and does so with accounts it sees using unofficial clients. Enable this only if you accept that risk for this number. postbote only reads: it never sends messages, read receipts or an online presence (it does acknowledge delivery, as every linked device must). WhatsApp keeps no server archive, so what postbote receives exists only in its local index, and WhatsApp unlinks a device that has not connected for about 14 days.",
