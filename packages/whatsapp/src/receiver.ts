/**
 * The receive path: one WhatsApp connection as a `DeliverySession`.
 *
 * It listens to Baileys' events, maps them (`map.ts`) and queues the result; the store engine
 * pulls batches with `nextBatch()` and writes each before asking for the next. The same class
 * serves `postbote sync` (`catch-up`) and a later daemon (`follow`) — they differ only in when
 * `nextBatch()` stops.
 *
 * When is `catch-up` done? WhatsApp has no "you are up to date" answer to ask for. What Baileys
 * reports is `receivedPendingNotifications` (the offline queue was handed over) and, on a freshly
 * linked device, history-sync chunks with a progress and a `messaging-history.status` when a
 * phase is complete. So: done once the offline queue was handed over, the first sync of a new
 * device has ended (Baileys raises `accountSyncCounter`), no history phase is still running,
 * and nothing arrived for `quietMs` — or, as a last resort, after `maxMs`
 * (reported as not caught up; what arrived is written either way).
 *
 * A dropped connection is reconnected (a fresh socket on the same auth state) up to
 * `maxReconnects` times; a logout is final and is reported as `loggedOut`, so a follow-mode
 * caller (the daemon) does not reconnect a device WhatsApp no longer knows. Nothing here sends
 * anything.
