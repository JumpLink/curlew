# ADR 0001 — curlew becomes a multi-protocol messenger; mail is one backend

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-09-25)
- **Scope:** `@curlew/protocol` (ports, DTOs, plugin API), `@curlew/store`, new backend
  packages, `app` (CLI, MCP, a later daemon and GUI)

## Context

curlew reads mail, contacts and calendars through GNOME Online Accounts, as a CLI and an MCP
server. The next need is chat: Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, later Matrix and XMPP. Two shapes
were on the table:

- **A separate multi-chat app.** It would have to rebuild or import what curlew already
  owns: the contact store (EDS), a sync engine behind a port, the SQLite index, the read-only MCP
  gate. And it adds another MCP server to every agent session, which is paid on every call.
- **curlew grows.** The name already fits (a Bote carries any message). The value a unified
  client adds is the per-person view — everything to and from one person, across networks —
  and that view needs the contacts curlew already has.

Bridges (mautrix and friends, a Matrix homeserver in the middle) were considered and rejected
for now: each network is handled directly in the app. A stranger installing curlew must not
need to run a homeserver.

## Decision

### 1. Mail is a backend like any other — but it is not dressed up as chat

At the port level, mail stands beside Signal and Matrix: same participant model, same
conversation model, same search. In presentation it keeps what makes it mail (subject, folders,
HTML body, attachments as documents). Delta Chat's approach — every message a bubble — works for
messages Delta Chat itself sends and fails for invoices, newsletters and long threads.

The store therefore classifies every mail **conversational** (from a known contact, or a thread
the user replied in) or **automated** (`List-Id`, `List-Unsubscribe`, `Auto-Submitted`,
`Precedence`, no-reply senders), correctable per sender. Conversational mail joins the
conversation list; automated mail stays in a mailbox view. The classification lives in the core
so the CLI and MCP get it too (`--people-only`), not only a future GUI.

### 2. Two sync models, declared by each backend

| Model | Backends | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Server archive** | IMAP, Telegram, Matrix, XMPP with MAM (XEP-0313) | The local index is rebuildable — `derived` in the state manifest |
| **Delivery only** | Signal, WhatsApp | Messages are gone from the server once delivered: a receiving daemon is required, and the local store is the only copy — `state` |

The sync engine branches on the declared model, never on the network name. Crypto stores kept by
native backends (presage, matrix-sdk) are `secret`, separate from the message store.

### 3. Capabilities, not a lowest common denominator

Each backend declares what it can do — edits, reactions, threads, read receipts, groups, E2EE,
subject, folders — and a **presentation kind** per message (`bubble` | `document` | `notice`: a
bubble, a document card, or something the network reported about the conversation that nobody
wrote). CLI, MCP and GUI hide what a backend cannot do, instead of branching on the network.

### 4. Identity: one participant, many typed addresses

Phone number, Telegram user, Matrix ID, JID and mail address are addresses of one person. A
participant carries several typed addresses and links to the EDS contact.

### 5. `@curlew/protocol` is the versioned plugin API

Backends implement the port declared in `protocol` and ship a manifest: name, plugin-API version,
capabilities, sync model, whether it is native, and a terms notice. Only backends enabled
explicitly in the config are loaded; the first enable shows the terms notice (the same gate idea
as troedler). Plugins are never fetched from the network at runtime.

Built-in backends go through the same interface, so the plugin API is used from day one:

| Backend | Where it ships | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| mail (IMAP; the existing code) | in the repo | the reference backend the port is proven against |
| Telegram, Matrix, XMPP | in the repo | open or officially permitted third-party clients |
| Signal | own package | native addon, per-platform prebuilds; the rest works without it |
| WhatsApp | own package **in this repo** | unofficial protocol, against WhatsApp's terms, real ban risk — kept self-contained (no other package imports it) so it can move to its own repository in one step if a takedown or ban wave makes that necessary |

### 6. Language per backend: the best implementation wins

TypeScript where a mature TypeScript library exists; Rust through a napi-rs (or Neon) addon
where the reference implementation is Rust and carries the cryptography. gjsify already runs
N-API addons on GJS. Vala only for a library that should also serve other GNOME apps through
GObject Introspection.

| Network | Choice | Verified in `refs/` |
|---|---|---|
| Telegram | **mtcute** (TypeScript, MIT) | runtime packages for Node, Bun, Deno, web; crypto in a `wasm` package, no native addon |
| Matrix | **matrix-rust-sdk** behind our own napi-rs crate — spike first | no Node binding in the tree (only uniffi FFI); `matrix-sdk-sqlite` store; Fractal builds on it |
| Signal | **`@signalapp/libsignal-client`** (Neon/N-API, Signal's own prebuilds) with a TypeScript service layer ported from Signal-Desktop's `ts/textsecure/` — **decided by the spike below**; presage rejected | presage: AGPL, no binding, SQLite(+SQLCipher) store; Flare reaches it through its own `flare-backend` wrapper |
| XMPP | **xmpp.js** (ISC) | no OMEMO anywhere in the tree; Dino ships its OWN OMEMO (`plugins/omemo/`, Vala+C) — the model for ours |
| WhatsApp | **Baileys** (MIT) | depends on `libsignal` and `whatsapp-rust-bridge`: not pure TypeScript |

Every candidate's license is compatible with curlew's AGPL-3.0-or-later (AGPL, MIT, ISC,
MPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1).

#### Signal: the spike (2026-09)

Measured, not assumed:

- **libsignal-client runs on GJS unmodified.** Its published linux-x64 `.node` (0.103.0) loads
  through gjsify's N-API host (`@gjsify/napi`). Keys, a PQXDH session from a pre-key bundle,
  encrypt/decrypt both ways, sealed sender and sender-key groups pass on GJS and Node alike. The
  store calls go from Rust back into JavaScript through thread-safe functions, so the async half
  of the host carries real traffic, not only synchronous calls.
- **The network has to be libsignal's.** `chat.signal.org` and the attachment CDNs chain to
  Signal's own root CA. A W3C WebSocket cannot pin a root, so the chat socket has to be
  libsignal's. (gjsify's `node:https` ignored `ca` when this was written; gjsify#1843 fixed that,
  which is what lets `httpsDownloader` fetch the contact blob over a pinned root on GJS.) That
  libsignal-net pins the root itself and carries TLS, the WebSocket
  and the framing inside the addon: its provisioning socket reached production and returned a
  link address in ~0.4 s on GJS. Signal-Desktop takes the same path
  (`SocketManager.getProvisioningConnection` → `connectProvisioning`).
- **presage costs more for less.** It sits on whisperfish's `libsignal-service-rs`, pinned to a
  git revision that pins libsignal's Rust crates and BoringSSL (552 crates in its lockfile).
  Using it means our own napi-rs crate plus a Rust+C++ build per platform in CI; Flare needs
  ~3.4k lines of `src/backend/` to wrap it. libsignal-client comes with prebuilds Signal
  maintains for linux, darwin and win32 (x64, arm64) and keeps in step with the server.

Consequence: Signal ships as `native: true` where gjsify's N-API host runs — **linux-x64 and
darwin-arm64 today** (win32 waits on gjs itself). curlew loads the addon only when Signal is
used, so the rest of curlew starts where it does not. The service layer (linking, envelope
decryption, sync messages, contact sync) is ported from Signal-Desktop with attribution; both
are AGPL.

### 7. Web standards first — and gaps are fixed in gjsify

gjsify's goal is to make web protocols and standards available on GJS. So a backend prefers the
library path that runs on **standard web APIs** (WebSocket, WebCrypto, WebAssembly, fetch,
streams) over a native addon, even where a native path exists. Every gap that path hits is fixed
**in the gjsify core**, with a test, never shimmed in curlew — the next GJS app needs the same
API. A native addon (napi-rs/Neon) is the fallback when no standards-based implementation exists,
not the default.

What the candidates need, verified in `refs/`:

| Library | Needs from the platform |
|---|---|
| mtcute (`packages/web`) | WebSocket, WebCrypto, WebAssembly (its crypto), IndexedDB — or a storage adapter of ours |
| Baileys | `ws`/WebSocket, WebAssembly (`whatsapp-rust-bridge` is Rust compiled to WASM, not a native addon), `libsignal` (JS), protobufjs |
| xmpp.js | TCP + STARTTLS (`node:net`/`node:tls`) or WebSocket |
| matrix-js-sdk | fetch, WebAssembly (`matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm`), IndexedDB or an in-memory/SQLite store |

This moves the Matrix spike: `matrix-js-sdk` with the crypto WASM runs first; our own napi-rs
crate over `matrix-rust-sdk` only if the WASM path cannot carry it.

### 8. Order

Port and store schema with both sync models, proven by mail → Telegram → Matrix → daemon +
Signal → XMPP → WhatsApp. Matrix comes early: official, server-archive, and its E2EE path was
meant as the first real test of a native addon in curlew; Matrix ended up on WASM, so Signal is
that test.

## GUI direction (later, recorded so the data model carries it now)

One app, `Adw.NavigationSplitView`: a sidebar with **Conversations** and **Mailbox**.

- A person's conversation interleaves chat bubbles and collapsed mail cards (subject,
  attachments, preview; expand to the full reader). Reply inline, by default on the channel of
  the last message; mail replies expand to a full composer.
- The mailbox is a classic list + reader for automated mail.

| Area | Model |
|---|---|
| Chat list and timeline | Flare, Paper Plane (the latter inactive since 2024-06) |
| Mail cards inside a conversation | Convey (a GTK4/libadwaita hard fork of Geary, Vala, uses GOA) |
| Mailbox, composer, privacy defaults | Hylki (Rust, relm4/libadwaita, IMAP/SMTP, own OAuth + keyring — curlew keeps GOA) |

## Consequences

- `store` gains conversation, participant and message tables, a mail thread builder
  (`References`/`In-Reply-To`) and the conversational/automated classification.
  `store` still never imports a backend.
- The existing IMAP code moves behind the new port before any new network lands.
- A daemon (systemd user unit) arrives with the first delivery-only backend.
- MCP tools stay read-only until a send path has its own decision record. Chat rows are other
  people's words: the privacy rules for MCP output apply to them unchanged.
- Native backends add prebuild packages per platform (gjsify's ADR 0017 mechanism).
